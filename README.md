# macOS-Scripts-and-Commands
Various collection of my personal macOS scripts and terminal commands

To run any of the .command files, you'll first need to give them executable permissions:

1. Open Terminal and paste "sudo chmod u+x " (with the space at the end)
2. Drag the .command file onto the Terminal window (to populate the file path name)
3. Enter password then press enter.

Note that since these scripts will be downloaded from the internet and are not signed with an Apple Developer ID, Apple will quarantine them. 
To bypass quarantine, simply right click on them and choose open.

If unsure about safety, confirm that these scripts are safe by asking chatgpt or upload them to virus total.

Enjoy!
